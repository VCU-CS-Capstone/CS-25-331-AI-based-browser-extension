# *CS 25-331 AI-based browser extension for knowledge management using retrieval-augmented generation and large language models*
## *VCU Campus of Engineering*
## *This project focuses on developing an AI-powered browser extension for efficient knowledge management. Using large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the extension will assist experts by simplifying the search and retrieval of specific information from vast documents.*
The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.
